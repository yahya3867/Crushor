# Crushor ðŸŽ®  

**Crushor** is a first attempt of a working retro-style 2D Platformer Game that I'm building just for fun. Right now I'm just experimenting with different mechanics.  

Eventually, I plan to incorporate **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** into the gameâ€”training AI to play, adapt, and (hopefully) dominate the gameplay. But for now, it's all about messing around and seeing where things go.  

More updates to come!

## Stay Tuned!  
If you're curious, feel free to check back later as I add more features and refine things.

*Just a fun side project for now!*
